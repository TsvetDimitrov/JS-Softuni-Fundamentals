// In the underground world of bunnies, mafia and corruption have taken over. 
// Snowball is on a mission to infiltrate a certain deserted military hanger, supposedly filled with convict bunnies. 
// You will be given a matrix of integers, each integer separated by a single space, and each row on a new line, 
// which will represent the current situation in the hangar. Then on the last line of input you will receive indexes - 
// coordinates to several cells in the hangar separated by a single space, in the following format: row1,column1  row2,column2  row3,column3… 
// On those cells there are bunnies with bombs. Snowball is smart and knows that the bombs are an easy way to neutralize enemies, 
// especially when they are the enemy’s own bombs.
// Snowball will proceed to eliminate every bunny with a bomb, one by one in the order they were given. When a bunny with a bomb is killed, it explodes and deals damage equal to its own integer value, to all the cells around it (in every direction and in all diagonals). If a bomb bunny is caught in the explosion and killed, that bomb is no longer valid and will not explode. When a bunny is damaged, it reduces its integer value by the damage value. When a bunny’s value reaches 0, it dies. When a bunny explodes, it dies.
// When Snowball is done with all the bomb bunnies, he will proceed to kill any other convict bunny which has remained alive. 
// You must count all the damage Snowball did in the hangar. Note that bomb explosion damage does not count as Snowballs damage,
//  but the killing of bomb bunnies and other bunnies DOES. Snowball’s damage for every bunny is equal to the bunny at that cell’s integer 
//  value.
// Input
// •	The input data is passed to the first function found in your code as an array of strings.
// •	Each entry in the array represents a row of the matrix, in the form of integers separated by a space.
// •	On the last line you will receive the coordinates of the cells with the bomb bunnies.
// Output
// •	On the first line you need to print Snowball’s damage.
// •	On the second line you need to print the amount of bunnies HE killed.
// Constraints
// •	The size of the matrix will be between [0…1000].
// •	 The coordinates to the bomb bunnies will always be in the matrix.
// •	The integers of the matrix will be in range [0…10000].
// •	Allowed time/memory: 250ms/16MB
