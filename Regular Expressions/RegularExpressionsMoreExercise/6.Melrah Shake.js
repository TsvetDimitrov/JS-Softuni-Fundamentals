// You are given a string of random characters, and a pattern of random characters.
//  You need to “shake off” (remove) all of the border occurrences of that pattern,
//   in other words, the very first match and the very last match of the pattern you find in the string.
// When you successfully shake off a match, you remove from the pattern the character 
// which corresponds to the index equal to the pattern’s length / 2.
//  Then you continue to shake off the border occurrences of the new pattern until the pattern becomes empty 
//  or until there is less than the - needed for shake, matches in the remaining string.
// In case you have found at least two matches, and you have successfully shaken them off, 
// you print "Shaked it." on the console. Otherwise you print "No shake.", the remains of the main string, 
// and you end the program. See the examples for more info.
// Input
// •	The input will consist only of two lines
// •	On the first line, you will get a string of random characters
// •	On the second line, you will receive the pattern and that ends the input sequence
// Output
// •	You must print "Shaked it." for every time you successfully do the melrah shake
// •	If the melrah shake fails, you print "No shake.", and on the next line you print what has remained of the main string
// Constraints
// •	The two strings may contain ANY ASCII character
// •	Allowed time/memory: 250ms/16MB
