// Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subsequence. 
// In other words, you start from the first element and continue to the end of the given array of numbers. 
// Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored, 
// alternatively if it’s equal or higher than the current biggest one you set it as the current biggest one and you continue to the next number. 
// Input
// The input comes as array of numbers.
// Output
// The output is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subsequence. 
// The elements should be printed on one line, separated by a single space.
