// In this problem you have to arrange all students by grade. 
// You as the secretary of the school principal will process students and store them into a school register before 
// the new school year hits. As a draft, you have a list of all the students from last year but mixed. 
// Ðšeep in mind that if a student has a lower grade than 3, he does not go into the next class. 
// As result of your work, you have to print the entire school register sorted in ascending order 
// by grade already filled with all the students from last year in format:
// {nextGrade} Grade
// List of students: {All students in that grade}
// Average annual grade from last year: {average annual grade on the entire class from last year}
// And empty row {console.log}
// The input will be array with strings, each containing a student's name, last year's grade, 
// and an annual grade. The average annual grade from last year should be formatted to the second decimal point.
