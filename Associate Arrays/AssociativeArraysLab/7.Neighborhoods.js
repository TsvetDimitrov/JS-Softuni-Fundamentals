// Write a function that receives list of neighborhoods and then some people, who are going to live in it. 
// The input will come as array of strings. The first element will be the list of neighborhoods separated by ", ". 
// The rest of the elements will be a neighborhood followed by a name of a person in the format:
//  "{neighborhood} - {person}". Add the person to the neighborhood only if the neighborhood is in the list of neighborhoods. 
//  At the end print the neighborhoods sorted by the count of inhabitants in descending order. Print them in the following format: 
// "{neighborhood}: {inhabitants count}
// --{1st inhabitant}
// --{2nd inhabitant}
// â€¦"
